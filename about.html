    <div class="description">
        <p>My name is Samuel Karanja. I'm a developer with a strong background in web-development and a keen eye
            for
            good design. I love <br> to make complex things simple and fun to use. Currently, I focus on building
            web apps
            with HTML, CSS Javascript and Bootstrap.</p>
        <p>Over the past few months as a self-taught developer and also as a student at Moringa School, I've gained
            experience across some aspects of the development <br> cycle including front-end, back-end and
            dev-ops.This
            allows me to take full ownership of a project from design to implementation and deployment.</p>
