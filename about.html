        <p>My name is Samuel Karanja. I'm a developer with a background in front-end web-development and a keen eye for
            good design. I love to make complex things simple and fun to use. Currently, I focus on building web apps
            with HTML, CSS Javascript and Bootstrap.</p>
        <p>Over the past few months as a self-taught developer and also as a student at Moringa School, I've gained
            experience across some aspects of the development cycle including front-end, back-end and dev-ops.This
            allows me to take full ownership of a project from design to implementation and deployment.</p>

        <div class="technical">
            <h2>Technical skill set</h2>
            <p>I am continously learning to keep up with the latest technologies and be able to pick the best tech for
                the
                job.</p>

        <div class="design">
            <h3>UI/UX Design</h3>
            <p>As a developer who majorly works with front-end development, I started to learn and gain experience for
                UX
                designng because everything I want everything I build to be user friendly. Figma is a great tool for
                creating designs and that is what I use.</p>

        <div class="html">
            <H3>HTML/CSS</H3>

            <h3>Bootstrap .2021</h3>
            <p>Being one of the most used frameworks by developers all over the world, Bootstrap is a great tool to
                create
                responsive websites and applications. I use Bootstrap to create my websites and custom layouts for
                different
